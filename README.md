# simplest ever flac decoder

1. open flac
2. read metadata
3. save image
4. play (soon)

## PLANS

# flac-wasm

**High-quality FLAC audio decoding in the browser with Rust and WebAssembly**

A minimal educational project that decodes FLAC audio files in the browser using a Rust-powered WebAssembly module. Built to learn Rust, bit manipulation, WebAssembly, and the Web Audio API—all while preserving lossless audio quality.

## Features

- Decodes FLAC files to raw PCM audio in the browser
- Zero external dependencies (pure Rust decoder)
- Clean Rust → WASM → TypeScript integration
- Demonstrates low-level audio processing and binary data handling

## Why?

- Learn FLAC format internals
- Practice Rust bit/byte manipulation
- Experiment with WASM audio processing
- Avoid browser codec inconsistencies (FLAC support varies)

> **Note**: This is a learning project—optimized for clarity, not performance.
